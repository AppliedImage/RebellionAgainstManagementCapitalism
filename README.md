# Rebellion Against Management Capitalism

The West is at risk of dying. We are growing sclerotic and slow. We spend more time avoiding suboptimal action than we spend taking good actions.

I want to dream of ways of breaking free of managerialism and once again embracing risk. I want to turn back the clock and become a young society again. We can. This is the era of the electron, of the internet, of AI and breakthroughs in physics and biology and cancer-curing-drugs and every other wonderful tool we now have that would have been inconceivably terrible magic in the past. We don't have to live by the old rules and patterns that dictate the deaths of societies and the ends of eras.

My best strategy so far is wondering if we can perhaps set up parallel institutions and regulatory schema to undergird a high-risk high agency society, starting with insurance. If such a parallel risk-friendly society could be constructed and then codified in a combination of legislation and common law, we could maybe naturally coexist and then defeat the current existing system in a legal and intuitive transfer of power.

A lot of the problems are related to an accretion of a risk averse common law and hyperactive tort law. i wonder if it would ge possible to make some sort of noncontiguos citizenshio under a different legal system yhat would allow people who wanted to live a risk friendly life to engage with each other in those ways under a legal system that validates rhem.
